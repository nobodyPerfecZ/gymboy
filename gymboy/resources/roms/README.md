## Storing ROM files

In order to use the environments from Gymboy, you need to store the ROM files (`*.gb` or `*.gbc`) in your file system.
This directory can be used to store the ROM files of GameBoy games.

### An example: Pokémon Blue environment
To use the Pokémon Blue environment, place the ROM file in the directory `pokemon/gen_1/blue` and name it `pokemon_blue.gb`.
This is the default identifier for `rom_path`.

If you are using custom paths for your ROM files, ensure that these paths are correctly specified in `rom_path`!
