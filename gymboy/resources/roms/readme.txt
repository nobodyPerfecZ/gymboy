To use the environments from GymBoy, you can add the ROM files here:

./gymboy/resources/roms/

Make sure the ROM files are in the correct format and named appropriately. For example, if you are using the Pokémon Gold environment, you should place the Pokémon Gold ROM file in this directory and name it `pokemon_gold.gb`.

Here is an example of how to organize your ROM files:

./gymboy/resources/roms/
    ├── pokemon_gold.gb
    └── other_game.gb

Once the ROM files are in place, you can proceed to register and use the environments as described in the previous sections of this README.
Ensure that the paths to the ROM files are correctly specified in rom_path=(...)!
